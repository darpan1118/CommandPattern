# Command Pattern C++ Demo
In this example of Command pattern, we are trying to create a simple input manager which will take some inputs from user and will print related action to that button. 

Using command pattern we can easily change which command should be used at a particular event. The best example would be control mapping in Games. If user wants to use X to jump instead of default A, then we just have to point X's press down to execute our jump command.
